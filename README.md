# Dialect map data

## About
This repository contains static data to be used in the rest of the Dialect Map components üí¨.

Jargons are grouped in order to improve _one-on-one_ comparison when the meaning of the
jargons are equal, although the term to describe it varies from science to science.
These groups are later on used by a range of data-ingestion pipelines to generate NLP metrics
on the ArXiv papers dataset, so they can be compared within the [Dialect map UI][dialect-map-ui].


## Environment setup
The project uses [AJV-CLI][ajv-cli-repository] to validate the JSON schemas, and the jargon list.
It can be installed by running:
```shell script
npm install --no-optional
```


## Syntax validation
To validate the JSON-Schema syntax:
```shell script
make validate
```


## Available data

### Categories
The full corpus of ArXiv categories is formed by both **currently** and **legacy** used ones.

- Current ones have been copied from the official [ArXiv category taxonomy][arxiv-guide-taxonomy].
- Legacy ones have been inferred from the public [ArXiv metadata dataset][arxiv-public-metadata].

### Jargons

#### Initial
The initial set of jargon groups was collected through a [Google form][google-form-jargons]
set up by Kyle Cranmer on Twitter, having the scientific community responses collected
from December 01 to December 31, 2020.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer: no more terms will be collected this way.**

#### New terms
New terms can be added by creating a _Pull Request_ (PR). These PRs will be later on reviewed
by the Dialect map team to ensure that the resulting JSON is well formatted.

- For information about **how to add new terms**, check the [contributing documentation][docs-contrib].
- For information about **how changes are propagated**, check the [computing documentation][docs-compute].
